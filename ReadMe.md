Originally suggested by Kofeyh of KSPTV, this super simple mod allows players to assign levels of throttle limiting to an engine on their craft through the magical power of action groups.

These action groups work like any of the stock ones, meaning they will also copy to symmetry counterparts.

Note that users of AGX will have to abide by AGX's cooldown periods and cannot simply spam a button. Plan your groups accordingly.

New Feature:  ThrottleLimiter
	This is a new part module which provides a minimum throttle setting, so that the throttle will never go below that (unless it's turned off)
